/* Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'.
 You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string.
 Note: If implementing in Java, please use Character array so that you can perform this operation in place
 Example:
 Input: "Mr John Smith      ", 13
 Output: "Mr$20John$20Smith"
/*

public class URLify

    public static String urlify(String s)
    {
      /* Convert String into Char Array
      Check for Spaces
      If space is found, check next two char's. If next 2 char has letters, run a charPushBack function
      charPushBack function: 
      char[] temp = copy of char[]
      when copy = i, add %20
      continue with copy, increasing i
